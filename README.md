What's left in project:

1. Proper README
2. Integration Tests
3. Programmatic Verification
4. Push to GitHub

A good README:

-   explain what your code actually does
-   and then how to actually do it

example:

1. Getting Started

    1. Requirements that you need to actually run anything
    2. Quickstart - starts with a git clone

2. How to actually use it

Look up "best README" for templates
